# Weekly Progress Updates
  # May 24, 2019
   This week what was done for our project was that we met and figured out more of the details of what to have for features for our project. We also started on the user login page for the website on the front end side and for the back end started making the tables for the database. Research was done as well on the possibility of using Amazon Web Service for a relational database with MySQL.
